# Plot.ly Challenge - Belly Button Biodiversity
![Bacteria by filterforge.com](Instructions/Images/bacteria.jpg)

In this challenge, build an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## Step 1: Plotly

1. Use the D3 library to read in `samples.json`.

2. Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

3. Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.

4. Display the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.

5. Create a gauge chart to plot the weekly washing frequency of the individual.

6. Update all of the plots any time that a new sample is selected.
